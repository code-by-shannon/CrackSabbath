Starting out in the avant-punk outfit Goddamn Sam, Shannon has spent nearly a decade in crowded honky tonks where the beer’s cold, the dance floor’s full, and the amps run hot.
He's chicken picked from San Diego to San Francisco to the neon glow of Las Vegas, delivering high-energy sets built for two-steppers, raised glasses, and long nights.
Now handling bass duties in Crack Sabbath, he moves between outlaw country and Sabbath thunder without missing a beat.

Ken Glaser (drums, vocals) has been immersed in music practically since birth. Raised in a large musical family, he taught himself drums and guitar at age 9 and formed his first band a year later. Ken has continued to write, record, and perform in tribute bands, cover bands, and original bands, and brings his experience and enthusiasm to every gig.

Philip Manikan began playing guitar in 1995, developing a deep connection to heavy riffs and dark melody. His style blends groove, grit, and atmosphere, shaped by decades immersed in the heavier side of rock.  Inspired by the riff-driven legacy of Black Sabbath and the unmistakable approach of Tony Iommi, Philip delivers thick tone, tight rhythm work, and expressive phrasing—bringing weight, precision, and authenticity to every performance.

Div (Lead Vocals)
As the youngest member of Crack Sabbath, Div Dive brings fresh energy and a modern edge to the band’s Sabbath sound. Her vocals carry both power and nuance, while her movement on stage adds a dynamic spark to every performance.  When she’s not channeling classic heavy metal, she’s developing solo projects and exploring new creative directions — always pushing herself musically and artistically.  Old riffs.  New blood!
